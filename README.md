This assignment was done by these 3 students through the collaboration policy.

Each program in this assignment was created in python3.

To run the programs, simply type "python3 prog_name"
Where prog_name is the program name that wished to be run


# Task 3: 
- Our interpretation of this task was to find how many listings each host own, sort the host_id in ascending order, then output the first 10 host_id (Ascending Order) with its corresponding amount of listing.
- To run:
     - Type "python3 prog_name" where prog_rame can be either A5T3SQLite.py or A5T3MongoDB.py
     - Should output the result
      
# Task 5:
- Our interpretation of this task was to multiply price by minimum_nights and take the average price of a given neighbourhood.
- To run:
     - Type "python3 prog_name" where prog_rame can be either A5T5SQLite.py or A5T5MongoDB.py
     - The program will ask the user to enter a neighbourhood
     - Once the neighbourhood has been entered, the neighbourhood with its corresponding average price will be displayed (rounded to a whole integer)
